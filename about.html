          <h1>About the Kona Manta Ray Sighting Data</h1>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="detail container-lg">
    <p>For many years, the Kona Manta Rays have been photographed and identified
    using their unique spot pattern on their ventral (abdominal) side. The first
    Kona Manta Ray ever identified was named Lefty, because she had a bent left cephalic fin.
    She may also be the oldest known manta ray. She was a mature adult female ray when
    when Steve Myklebust first realized that it was the same manta ray returning to the
    Keauhou dive site repeatedly since mid 1979.
    </p>
    <p>The manta identification project was started in 1991 by Keller and Wendy Laros,
    Co-Founders of
    <a href="https://www.mantapacific.org/" target="_blank">Manta Pacific Research Foundation (MPRF).</a>
    Naturally, Lefty became "Manta #1" and they started producing a Booklet
    with thumbnail photos of each manta's spot pattern in order to more easily identify them
    and keep track of them. Keller also started recording in a logbook which individual 
    mantas were seen each evening at the dive
    site in Keauhou which was becoming a more popular tourist destination.
    </p>
    <p>In 2003, Janice McLaughlin, also a Co-Founder of MPRF, took over the ID management
    responsibilities and created a website for MPRF that was able to show everyone the
    photos and story of each
    identified manta ray. She also created a website form system for dive guides to
    be able to report and log, when and where individual manta rays were seen.
    </p>
    <p>In 2015, Janice designed and created an online database to start recording this 
    information into a more usable format. She also wrote an
    <a href="https:www.mantarays.info"target="_blank">iOS App for mobile users</a>
    to be able to view the current mantas and to report their own images and sighting information while
    on the water. The manta list continues to this day where
    we have more than 295 unique individuals identified.
    </p>
    <p>Now, starting in 2020, Thanks to the below individuals, we now have Web access
    to the same database and can make the manta viewing experience, easier, more
    modern, and especially ... always up to date!
